It can automatically generate features from secondary datasets which can then be used in machine learning models.  In this post we'll see how automated feature engineering with Featuretools works, and how to run it on complex multi-table datsets!\n\n**Outline**\n- [Automated Feature Engineering](#automated-feature-engineering)\n- [Deep Feature Synthesis](#deep-feature-synthesis)\n- [Using Featuretools](#using-featuretools)\n- [Predictions from Generated Features](#predictions-from-generated-features)\n- [Running out of Memory](#running-out-of-memory)\n"

      "source": "<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"automated-feature-engineering\"></a>\n## Automated Feature Engineering\n\nWhat do I mean by \"automated feature engineering\" and how is it useful?  When building predictive models, we need to have training examples which have some set of features.  For most machine learning algorithms (though of course not all of them), this training set needs to take the form of a table or matrix, where each row corresponds to a single training example or observation, and each column corresponds to a different feature.  For example, suppose we're trying to predict how likely loan applicants are to successfully repay their loans.  In this case, our data table will have a row for each applicant, and a column for each \"feature\" of the applicants, such as their income, their current level of credit, their age, etc.\n\nUnfortunately, in most applications the data isn't quite as simple as just one table.  We'll likely have additional data stored in other tables!  To continue with the loan repayment prediction example, we could have a separate table which stores the monthly balances of applicants on their other loans, and another separate table with the credit card accounts for each applicant, and yet another table with the credit card activity for each of those accounts, and so on. \n\n![Data table tree](/assets/img/featuretools/DataframeTree.svg)\n\nIn order to build a predictive model, we need to \"engineer\" features from data in those secondary tables.  These engineered features can then be added to our main data table, which we can then use to train the predictive model.  For example, we could compute the number of credit card accounts for each applicant, and add that as a feature to our primary data table; we could compute the balance across each applicant's credit cards, and add that to the primary data table; we could also compute the balance to available credit ratio and add that as a feature; etc.\n\nWith complicated (read: real-life) datasets, the number of features that we could engineer becomes very large, and the task of manually engineering all these features becomes extremely time-intensive.  The [Featuretoools](https://www.featuretools.com/) package automates this process by automatically generating features for our primary data table from information in secondary data sources."

      "source": "<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"deep-feature-synthesis\"></a>\n## Deep Feature Synthesis\n\nFeaturetools uses a process they call \"deep feature synthesis\" to generate top-level features from secondary datasets.  For each secondary table, the child table is merged with the parent table on the column which joins them (usually an ID or something).  Raw features can be transformed according to *transform primitives* like `month` (which transforms a datetime into a month, or `cum_sum` which transforms a value to the cumulative sum of elements in that aggregation bin.  Then, features are built from \"aggregation primitives\", such as mean, sum, max, etc, which aggregate potentially multiple entries in the child table to a single feature in the parent dataset.  This feature generation process is repeated recursively until we have a single table (the primary table) with features generated from child and sub-child (etc) tables."

      "cell_type": "markdown",
      "source": "<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"using-featuretools\"></a>\n## Using Featuretools\n\nTo show how Featuretools works, we'll be using it on the [Home Credit Group Default Risk](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk/data) dataset.  This dataset contains information about individuals applying for loans with [Home Credit Group](http://www.homecredit.net/), a consumer lender specializing in loans to individuals with little credit history.  Home Credit Group hopes to be able to predict how likely an applicant is to default on their loan, in order to decide whether a given loan plan is good for a specific applicant (or whether to suggest a different payment schedule).  \n\nThe dataset contains multiple tables which relate to one another in some way.  Below is a diagram which shows each data table, the information it contains, and how each table is related to each other table.\n\n![File connection columns](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/competitions/home-credit/home_credit.png)\n\nThe primary tables (`application_train.csv` and `application_test.csv`) have information on each of the loan applications, where each row corresponds to a single application.  The train table has information about whether that applicant ended up defaulting on their loan, while the test table does not (because those are the applications we'll be testing our predictive model on).  The other tables contain information about other loans (either at other institutions, in the `bureau.csv` and `bureau_balance.csv` tables, or previous loans with Home Credit, in `previous_applications.csv`, `POS_CASH_balance.csv`, `instalments_payments.csv`, and `credit_card_balance.csv`).\n\nWhat are the relationships between these tables?  The value in the `SK_ID_CURR` column of the `application_*.csv` and `bureau.csv` tables identify the applicant.  That is, to combine the two tables into a single table, we could merge on `SK_ID_CURR`.   Similarly, the `SK_ID_BUREAU` column in `bureau.csv` and `bureau_balance.csv` identifies the applicant, though in this case there can be multiple entries in `bureau_balance.csv` for a single applicant.  The text in the line connecting the tables in the diagram above shows what column two tables can be merged on.\n\nWe could manually go through all these databases and construct features based on them, but this would entail not just a lot of manual work, but a *lot* of design decisions.  For example, should we construct a feature which corresponds to the maximum amount of credit the applicant has ever carried?  Or the average amount of credit?  Or the monthly median credit?  Should we construct a feature for how many payments the applicant has made, or how regular their payments are, or *when* they make their payments, etc, etc, etc? \n\nFeaturetools allows us to define our datasets, the relationships between our datasets, and automatically extracts features from child datasets into parent datasets using deep feature synthesis.  We'll use Featuretools to generate features from the data in the secondary tables in the Home Credit Group dataset, and keep features which are informative. \n\nFirst let's load the packages we need."

This means that the number of features which are generated can be *huge*!  When dealing with large datasets, this means that the feature generation process might take up more memory than is available on a personal computer.  If you run out of memory, you can always [run featuretools on an Amazon Web Services EC2 instance](https://brendanhasz.github.io/2018/08/30/aws.html) which has enough memory, such as the `r5` class of instances."
